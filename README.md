![Sealy CI](https://github.com/boolYikes/sealy/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Infra
- FastAPI
### API Hosting
- Google Cloud Run: scales to zero on idle, cheap, handle quite a lot of reqs
- Google Compute Engine
- Cloudflare
### DB Hostings
- Run it on the same VM as API (warning, hands-on)
- Or use managed (expensive)
### Logging and Metrics
- Measure queries per endpoints

## DB Design
1. Schema design
   - correct pk
   - proper fk
   - avoid unncessary joins
   - don't over-normalize
2. Indexing
   - Index the search target table not the source
3. Access patterns > theoretical purity
   - most frequented queries? -> optimize specifically for that. Analyze traffic
   - done with pre-join, materialized views, small denormalization
4. Connection management
   - use connection pool. don't open a new db connection **per request!**
5. Query count per request
   - one request should be 1 to 3 queries not ten something queries (worst case db latency 10ms -> must be < 200ms according to SLO)
   - no looped queries! let the query do the job

### Project structure
- `db` for db models, `schemas` for pydantic api shape
- `sealy` for source code, `tests` for tests

### Note
- **Run migration tests on a fresh DB, not reused one**
- Keep schema tests read-only
- API tests should treat DB as a black box
   - Use markers e.g.,:
	- @pytest.mark.integration
	- @pytest.mark.api
- **Model change -> gen revision -> inspect/mod revision -> upgrade**
- **Reset and clean up migrations before prod**
- **Include `op.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext")` in the init migration**
- **Alembic only generates enum for op.create_table() not op.execute() -> explicitly create types in revisions**

### TODO
- Drop unnecessary ids
- JWT + argon2 pw hashing
- token refresh
- Errors
- Firebase messaging -> push

### Non-negotiables
- **Clear README (setup, usage, architecture)**
- **Environ, secrets**
- **Structured logging**
- **Error handling**
- **Dockerize**
- **More tests**
- **Config separation (dev/prod)**
- **CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)**
- **Database migrations**
- **Health checks**
- **Monitoring hooks**
- **Realistic data volumes**
- **API versioning**
